        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a technical professional passionate about software engineering, DevOps, IT, and infrastructure. Currently, I work at Hillspire LLC, where I manage IT operations, automate onboarding workflows, and support users across macOS, Windows, and mobile platforms using tools like JAMF, ManageEngine, Okta, and Google Workspace.
          <br><br>
          With hands-on experience in system automation, cloud tools, and user management at scale, I’ve developed a strong interest in building reliable, scalable internal systems. I enjoy writing scripts (PowerShell, Google Apps Script) to streamline IT processes and improve operational efficiency.
          <br><br>
          My broader interests include cloud infrastructure, DevOps tooling, secure software development, and game development. I'm currently expanding my skills in containerization, scripting, and cloud services to support long-term goals in technical operations and software reliability.
          <br><br>
          Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball and golf, building games in Godot, and following the Golden State Warriors and Liverpool FC. I’m also a huge fan of manga and anime!
          <br><br>
          Let’s connect and talk about DevOps, automation, infrastructure, software, or anything tech-related!
